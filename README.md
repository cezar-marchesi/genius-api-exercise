# genius-api-exercise
A flask application to retrieve data from the Genius API

By passing the name of an artist or band, it will return the top 10 songs from said artist/band
#
### Endpoints

```
/genius/<artist_name>/cache=<cache>
```

Will return the artist name with a list of the top 10 most popular songs from the artist.
The `cache` parameter is optional, if left empty, it will default to True and will use the latest cached data, if set to False, it will erase the cached data and make a new request to the Genius API.

#

## Usage

To use the application you will need your own api token provided by the Genius API. For that you will need to create an account. For information on how to get it click [here](https://docs.genius.com/#/getting-started-h1).

You will also need a redis server and a dynamodb connection.

Install the necessary packages by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


You will need a .env file. There is a .env_example file in the project that has all the environment variables, just fill up the blanks and rename it to .env.
```
# The token generated by the Genius API for your personal use
CLIENT_TOKEN=

# Host name for the redis server
REDIS_HOST=

# Host port for the redis server
REDIS_PORT=

# Dynamodb endpoint
DYNAMODB_ENDPOINT=

# For local development it can be a generic string like Test
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=

# For local development it can be a generic string like Test
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
```

With the .env file ready and the redis server and dynamodb, just build and run the Dockerfile. The Dockerfile is exposing the port 7007.
